# Securing-IoT-Infrastructure
AES, TLS/SSL Certificates &amp; API Key

IoT Security Experiment:

1. Arduino board equipped with an ultrasonic sensor to collect data, which is then encrypted and decrypted for secure transmission.
2. NodeMCU board with a raindrop sensor to capture data, which is subsequently transmitted using an API Key.
3. NodeMCU board along with a DHT11 sensor to gather data, which is then sent to an MQTT broker using TLS/SSL certificate.
